# Todo

- Linked list implementation

	- Insertion using emplacement tests (so that iterators to ints can work for a class or something)
	- Iterator validity tests for each function

- BST implementations and balanced variants using inheritance
- Red black tree reimplemented
	- Empty sentinel node (no allocation)

	- Iterator, node should be an internal type

- Compound type testing
- Better SFINAE: iterator checking (maybe specific operators are present)
