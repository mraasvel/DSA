# Todo

- Linked list implementation

	- Non-member functions
	- Swap overload: does it actually overload the std::swap?
	- Iterator validity tests for each function
	- cplusplus.com checks
	- Testing: permutations and automation, there are only so many inputs and variations for each function (sizes: 1, 2, 3, 5)

- CGI integration

- BST implementations and balanced variants using inheritance
- Red black tree reimplemented
	- Empty sentinel node (no allocation)

	- Iterator, node should be an internal type

- Compound type testing
- Better SFINAE: iterator checking (maybe specific operators are present)
