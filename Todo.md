# Todo

- Linked list implementation
	- Go through functions/methods in order: read specification more clearly, and apply missing requirements
	- Exception and complexity condition specified for each function, am I following the requirement?
	- Catch tests for all functions made so far
- BST implementations and balanced variants using inheritance
- Red black tree reimplemented
	- Empty sentinel node (no allocation)

	- Iterator, node should be an internal type

- Better SFINAE: iterator checking (maybe specific operators are present)
